```
**Validation comment**:I am not totally sure but the difference between NAs between the DS variable and the raw data might be due to the operator ">", if you put the value in strings such as '2', R recognizes it as a text or categorical value so maybe that is why the operator for integers or numbers did not work very well. Converting the variable to integer returns the right number of NAs.

**Harmonization status**:  complete    
**Harmonization comment**:  GLOBE asks about contact frequency with relatives which to some respondents might include siblings and children. GLOBE item G14v39 was not used to harmonize this DataSchema since that item asks about how often one sees relatives, indicating in person contact, as opposed to communicate with. 
**Validation comment**:  Because this variable asks "How many of these relatives..." it must be referring to G14v36 which asks them to exclude partner and children living at home.  
**Correction comment**: The study-specific variable asks about the contact with relatives that one feels close to, excluding partner and children living at home. The study-specific category "Several times a month or Once a week"" is coded under the category Biweekly in-person contact with friends.

**Harmonization comment**: In the 1991 wave, this item only asked of a sub-sample of persons hence lots of NAs. Support from top 3 contact persons averaged, e.g. if respondent states that she/he does not receive support from 2 persons out of 3, and sometimes receives support from the third person, she/he are categorized as never receiving support.      
**Validation comment**: The study variables used for harmonization ask: Do you get affection from this person, does this person embrace or kiss you or give you an affectionate handshake? Isn't it more likely that the participants would interpret this question as physical affection, rather than emotional affection?

Could we consider either of the questions:"Do you see that this person cares for you?" or "Do you show this person your blunders?" as recieved emotional support or would it be perceived emotional support?

**Code** | **Category Label**  
------------- | -------------  
0 |  Never received instrumental support
1 |  Sometimes received instrumental support
2 |  Often received instrumental support

**Harmonization status**:  complete    
**Harmonization comment**:  Support from top 3 contact persons averaged, e.g. if respondent states that she/he does not receive support from 2 persons out of 3, and sometimes receives support from the third person, she/he are categorized as never receiving support.      
**Validation comment 1**: Maybe we should add: g9i1: Would this person accompany with you when you find it difficult to go somewhere alone?
r52h1: Would this person offer you practical assistance like giving you a ride or doing your shopping, etc? in harmonization of this variable, since these are also forms of tangible/insturmental support
**Validation comment 2**: I think including the study-specific question/s in the harmo comment could be good in order to indicate that it is not necessarily about financial support. 
**Validation comment 3**: Is this method of taking a mean a common practice in the field? Otherwise, should we try to consider this harmonization method again? Because an argument could be: for example if a person gets support from one person often and sometimes gets support from the other 2, then she/he might feel like getting support often, as an average; or if she get supports often from 2, but never from 1; she might still feel like getting support often as an average?
