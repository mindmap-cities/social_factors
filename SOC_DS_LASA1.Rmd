### **Variable label**:   Ranked network size of children          
**Variable name**:   soc_sn_children_rank_3      
**Variable description**:  Indicator of whether the participant has a low, medium or high network size compromised of children. It is measured by ranking the size of the network which is comprised of any type of child (biological, step, adoptive, foster, in-law son/daughter).  Low rank indicates no children.
