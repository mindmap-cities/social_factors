**Variable name**:   soc_sn_children_rank_4      
**Variable description**:  Indicator of whether the participant has a low, medium or high network size compromised of children. It is measured by ranking the size of the network which is comprised of any type of child (biological, step, adoptive, foster, in-law son/daughter).  Low rank indicates no children.  Note: cohorts inquire about different types of children due to the particular questionnaire used, therefore a childless respondent in one study would not necessarily be considered childless in another study.

**Category coding**:

### **Variable label**: Perceived emotional support Z-score   
**Variable name**:   soc_ss_Zscore_perceived_emo_6        
**Variable description**:  Z-score of perceived emotional support from the participant's three social network members that they indicated they are closest to.  
**Value type**:  integer

**Category coding**:  
 
**Harmonization status**: complete 
**Harmonization comment**:  Study specific variable is composed of 5 items (1: There is always someone I can talk to about my day-to-day problems, 4:There are plenty of people I can lean on when I have problems, 7:There are many people I can trust completely, 8:There are enough people I feel close to, 11:	I can call on my friends whenever I need them) of the 11-item De Jong Gierveld scale.  Items were not reverse coded so that a higher Z-score indicates higher perceived emotional support.
